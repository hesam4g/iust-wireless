You should first run histscan.sh and then histogram.gnu. Instructions are provided in each file.

The modifications for this assignment:

. You should automatically discover the available SSIDs and add them to the histogram.
. The y-axis should be indexed by actual RSSI value (in dBm, e.g., -67). 
. The y-limits of the histogram should not change and should be between 0dBm and -100dBm.
. Any new AP should be automatically discovered.
. Your script should work in real time, showing new APs as they appear.
. The script should not change the order of the APs on the histogram.

These requirements are a MUST. In addition, the best three products will get bonus marks of:
